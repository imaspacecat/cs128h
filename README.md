Our project implemenents Canny Edge Detection , which is used to find edges in images. The program takes an image, converts it to grayscale, calculates gradients to find where the edges are, thins them out to make them cleaner, and then filters out weak edges. In the end, it spits out a new image that highlights just the edges. It's a cool way to learn how image processing works with Rust!
